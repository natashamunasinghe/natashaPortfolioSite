DESIGN

**Design process**
As this is a personal project, I wanted a design that represented me authentically and that I felt comfortable and confident with. I am a fan of minimalism and the 'less is more' philosophy.

*User point of view*
I also considered the website from the point of view of my users - mainly recruiters, employers and internship providers.

I explored extra resources including;
1) Canva https://www.canva.com/learn/minimalist-design-beautiful-examples-and-practical-tips/

2) UX planet - https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-minimalist-design-7af4a9b61ad7

3) Free Code Camp - https://medium.freecodecamp.org/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae

*Choose a design*
I then chose the design and UX of a website I really enjoyed and then built my website based on aspects I liked. The website I used is http://mattfarley.ca/

**Usability considerations**

The following factors were taken into account when designing the website;
1) Making it a clean clutter free website
2) Making a personal and quick positive first impression
3) Making very easy and obvious points; and not trying to confuse the user
4) Putting the nav bar on the top left corner as this is valuable real estate on a website according to eye tracking studies
5) Using bright and happy colours
6) Designing according to visual hierarchies and maximsing elements like headers
7) Making it platform friendly for mobile, tablet and desktop

PLANNING

I wanted to get my design and my website completed by Friday evening.

DAY 1 - Planning design and project planning including confirming a website design I liked. I also decided what framework to use - Bootstrap. I also kept a backlog of features to be able to add in, if I had the time to do it. I also create the user stories and wanted to focus on highlighting my key skills.
DAYS 2 & 3 - I started building the site on these 2 days 
DAYS 4 & 5 - reserved for documentation, presentation preparation and addition of backlog features

UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERNET
**Key events in the development of the internet from 1980s to present**

- In the 1980s, DARPA supports the transition of the entire network to the TCP/IP protocols and IBM launches PC in 1981.At this stage this network is accessible mostly to Defence, academic and a few corporate organisations. 1984 saw the launch of the Apple MAC and this user-friendly interface made computers much more accessible.
1983 also saw the establishment of DNS and 1984 saw the term “cyberspace” coined
- 1989 saw the introduction of the hypertext system and introduction of the World Wide Web
- 1990s saw the incorporation of companies like Amazon, Yahoo and Google and 1998 saw the introduction of IPv6. Microsoft also launches a browser for Windows. The number of computers has increased from 2000 in 1985 to 2 million in 1993
2000s saw the birth of social media companies including Facebook as well as the burst of the dot-com bubble
2009 was the Internet’s 40 anniversary
   
**Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers**

Domains – these refer to the location of websites on the internet

DNS – These are domain name servers and is where the domain name and IP address are stored. When a domain name is typed in, the browser checks for the DNS. The DNS translates the domain name to an IP, and a request is sent to the server for the website

Web browsers -This is how you search for URLs. If the URL has a domain name, it connects first to the DNS and retrieves the corresponding IP address for that web server which the browser connects to the web server and sends a HTTP request for the desired web page.

Web servers – This then receives the request and checks for the correct page and if it exists, the server sends it and if it doesn’t exist, sends a 404 error message. Web servers use HTTP to serve these pages to users.

**Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today**

Internet technology has changed the world of work and what it means to have a job and career. It has led to the democratisation of work and jobs. 
Here are some of the new ways of working as a result of technology developments; you can
1. Work from anywhere for certain professionals connecting via a computer only at times
2. Outsource work to people in global locations. This has led to the growth of websites such as freelancer.com, odesk.com and so forth where you can access labour and skills at costs much less to your home country at times
3. Work in virtual teams with colleagues in different locations to you
4. Find jobs using online medium like job sites as well as social media websites like LinkedIn
5. Be found online by recruiters and employers who will research you and make assessments about you from your digital profile
