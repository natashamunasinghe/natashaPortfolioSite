DESIGN

**Design process**
As this is a personal project, I wanted a design that represented me authentically and that I felt comfortable and confident with. I am a fan of minimalism and the 'less is more' philosophy.

*User point of view*
I also considered the website from the point of view of my users - mainly recruiters, employers and internship providers.

I explored extra resources including;
1) Canva https://www.canva.com/learn/minimalist-design-beautiful-examples-and-practical-tips/

2) UX planet - https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-minimalist-design-7af4a9b61ad7

3) Free Code Camp - https://medium.freecodecamp.org/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae

*Choose a design*
I then chose the design and UX of a website I really enjoyed and then built my website based on aspects I liked. The website I used is http://mattfarley.ca/

PLANNING

**Project plan and timelinew**

I have a very busy weekend where I will be working so I wanted to get my design and my website completed by Friday evening.

DAY 1 - Planning design and project planning including confirming a website design I liked. I also decided what framework to use - Bootstrap. I also kept a backlog of features to be able to add in, if I had the time to do it. I also create the user stories and wanted to focus on highlighting my key skills.
DAYS 2 & 3 - I started building the site on these 2 days 
DAYS 4 & 5 - reserved for documentation, presentation preparation and addition of backlog features
